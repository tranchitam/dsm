DSM is a small application which supports employees report their tasks everyday to their project manager. The functionalities are very simple. The employee will report their tasks by answering 3 questions: what they did yesterday, what they will do today and whether they have any difficulties on tasks. The main purpose of this project is to help me consolidate knowledge when I learn NodeJS, Socket IO, MongoDB and AngularJS.

To run this application, you have to follow these steps:
- Install MongoDB https://www.mongodb.org
- Install NodeJS and npm https://nodejs.org
- Go to project directory and install NodeJS dependencies by using command "npm install"
- Start application by command "node index.js"
- Open url http://localhost:8080 by web browser
